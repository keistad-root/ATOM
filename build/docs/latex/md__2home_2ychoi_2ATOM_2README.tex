The project title "{}\+ATOM"{} is abbreviation of APTS Task Organisation Machine. This project is based on \href{https://gitlab.cern.ch/alice-its3-wp3/apts-dpts-ce65-daq-software}{\texttt{ MLR1 DAQ Software}} made by CERN ALICE group. The existing code, however, was written by Python code. So the code was re-\/made by C++ and ROOT programing language for shorter runtime and efficient memory management.
